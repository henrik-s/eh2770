\section{Transformation Plan}
\label{sec:transformation_plan}
This section contains the identified gaps between As-Is and To-Be, these gaps can be divided up and translated into key work packages essential for realising the envisioned architecture. Additionally, the work packages are then depicted in a gantt diagram; the purpose of this is twofold, to estimate the duration of each work package as well as getting a sense for the internal dependencies among them. This section presents this whole transformation plan of how to reach the To-Be architecture from today's.

\subsection{Activities}
In the following three tables the activities associated with respective model (claim, order and support) are listed. For each table the activities are ordered by execution priority, i.e. activities are executed top-down.
